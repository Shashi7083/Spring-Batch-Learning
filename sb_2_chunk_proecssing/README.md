# 🌀 Spring Batch Learning Project : Chunk Based 

Welcome to my **Spring Batch Learning** project!  
This is where I explore how batch processing works in Java using **Spring Boot and Spring Batch**.

## 🚀 What I’ve Learned So Far

🔹 How to create a basic **Spring Batch Job**  
🔹 How to add **multiple steps** inside a single job  
🔹 Understanding the role of:
- 🧩 `Job`
- 🧩 `Step`
- 📥 `ItemReader`
- 🔄 `ItemProcessor`
- 📤 `ItemWriter`  
🔹 How the **execution flow** works using `JobInstance` and `JobExecution`
